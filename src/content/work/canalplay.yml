      Canalplay provides access to thousands of programs from your phone, tablet,
      computer or on your TV.

      This last support and my previous experience with the CANAL+ box - called "Cube S" - gave me
      the opportunity to develop the entire HTML5 application.

          Very large catalog, recommended content and intuitive UX were the 3 pillars of this
          initial concept to cater public demand.

          I spent most of my time to perfect the infinite and scrollable mosaic contents dealing
          with the performance of the Cube S processor. I remain full of different techniques to
          achieve the best possible result. This means thinking outside the box! (sorry)
