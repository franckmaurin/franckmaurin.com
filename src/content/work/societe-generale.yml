summary: >
  This project was my first opportunity to work with the most rock''n''roll
  Parisian web agency: <a href="http://www.uzik.com" target="_blank">Uzik</a>. It
  showed me an involved team who completed the project starting from taking photographs
  until the final deployment.

          As we started to develop the product, we decided to focus our efforts
          on the most important thing for a musical sponsorship website: music shouldn't
          be cut between pages.

          This implies that all site requests is done asynchronously. With my colleague developer,
          we needed to be agiles to define the best match between
          my handcrafted front-end code and his Zend framework based back-end.

          Compatibility with IE 6-7 being required, I used jQuery library to develop custom liquid
          slider and all the website animations.
