      For a month, CANAL+ & CANALSAT VOD offers more than 10,000 programs to see or see again
      anytime. I was in charge of developing this service where the particularity was to manage
      the remote control events with different modules like the mosaic of contents, the menu or the
      search engine. I used Backbone framework and BEM logical to help me to structure my code.
